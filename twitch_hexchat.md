## HEXCHAT / TWITCH

**Here's a method to chat in a twitch #channel with HexChat**

1. Get HexChat here (or your package manager): https://hexchat.github.io/

3. Click `Add` and name it Twitch or whatever.

4. Now click `Edit` and change the server/port up top to: `irc.chat.twitch.tv/6697`

5. Check `Use SSL for all the servers on this network`.

6. Uncheck `Use global user information` (you'll be using your twitch nick).

7. Change the `Login Method` to `Server password (/PASS password)`.

8. In `Password` paste in the token generated here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

_Additionally I'd uncheck `Connect to this network automatically`._

_You only need to set the `Nick name` which needs to be your Twitch nick._

9. Click `Close` then `Connect` and in the window that opens, you can type `/join #twitch_channel_name_here`.

    If this is your first time running, an extra GUI will pop up asking you if you want to join a channel. I like to tell this to never open and use the `/join` method mentioned.
